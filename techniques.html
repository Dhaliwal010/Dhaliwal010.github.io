            <h2>Crop Rotation</h2>
            <p>Crop rotation involves growing different crops in sequence on the same land. This practice helps manage soil fertility, reduce pest and disease pressure, and improve overall farm productivity.</p>
            <h3>Why this is Important?</h3>
            <p>If a farmer continually plants the same crop in the same area of land the are will be depleted of that nutrient and pests will make themselves at home as their food sources is guaranteed in the area. Crop rotation helps to reduce this without synthetic inputs.</p>

        <section id="ipm">
            <h2>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h2>
            <p>IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, and modification of cultural practices.</p>

        <section id="conservation-tillage">
            <h2>Conservation Tillage</h2>
            <p>This technique minimizes soil disturbance, reducing erosion and improving soil health, conservation tillage is any tillage practice that builds up crop residues on the soil surface to minimize the impact of water and wind erosion. It includes practices like no-till or reduced-till farming.</p>

        <section id="agroforestry">
            <h2>Agroforestry</h2>
            <p>Agroforestry integrates trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems. This practice enhances biodiversity, improves soil health, and provides additional income through diverse products.</p>
            <h3>Benefits include</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Protect soil, animals, and homes from extreme weather</li>
                <li>Improve water quality</li>
                <li>Produce products</li>
                <li>Produce jobs and income</li>
                <li>Provide habitat</li>
